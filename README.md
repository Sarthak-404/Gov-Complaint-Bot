# 🛠 Complaint Assistant API

This is an intelligent complaint-handling Flask API that analyzes user complaints using **LLMs (LLaMA3 via Groq)** and categorizes them by **urgency, department, category, and subcategory**. It also supports **image captioning** using **Salesforce's BLIP** model to interpret image-based complaints.

    - **Main Categories:** Corruption, Crime, Electricity Issue, Public Transport, Road Maintenance, Water Supply.
    - **Subcategories:** Chain Snatching, Power Outage, Potholes, etc.
  - Assigns complaints to the correct **department**.

- 🖼 **Image-to-Text**
